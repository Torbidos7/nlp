# NLP 

This repository is dedicated to explores the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The focus is on understanding and implementing the basics to learn how NLP works.

## Topics Covered

1. **Bag of Words**: The Bag of Words model is a simplifying representation used in NLP and information retrieval (IR). In this model, a text (such as a sentence or a document) is represented as the bag (multiset) of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity. The notebook demonstrates how to use the Bag of Words model to predict the class object of a sentence.
2. **Bigrams**: A bigram or digram is a sequence of two adjacent elements from a string of tokens, which are typically letters, syllables, or words. The notebook shows how to generate bigrams from sentences and use them in a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for prediction.
3. **Word Vectors**: Word vectors represent words as multidimensional continuous floating-point numbers where semantically similar words are mapped to proximate points in geometric space. In simpler terms, a word vector is a row of real-valued numbers (as opposed to dummy numbers) where each point captures a dimension of the word's meaning and where semantically similar words have similar vectors. This means that words such as wheel and engine should have similar word vectors to the word car, whereas the word banana should be quite distant.


## Conclusion

This project serves as a starting point for NLP understanding. It is mainly for self-learning purposes and is not intended to be a comprehensive guide. I hope you find it useful.
